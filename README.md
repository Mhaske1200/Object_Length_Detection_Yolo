# Object Length Detection with YOLOv8

## Overview
This project utilizes the YOLOv8 model for object detection and segmentation, specifically focusing on accurately measuring the length of objects within images or video frames. The YOLOv8 model is known for its efficiency and high accuracy in detecting objects, making it ideal for applications requiring precise measurements.

## Features
- **Object Detection:** Utilizes YOLOv8 for real-time object detection and segmentation.
- **Length Measurement:** Calculates the length of detected objects within images or video frames.
- **Efficiency:** Optimized for performance to handle large-scale datasets and real-time applications.
- **Flexibility:** Easily adaptable for various use cases requiring object length measurements.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Mhaske1200/Object_Length_Detection_Yolo.git
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the demo script to see object length detection in action: python video_check.py
